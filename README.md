## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on learning more about CRUD and utilizing the get, post, put, delete methods correctly.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned, on a fundamental level, how to use express.js. I learned more about setting up GET requests, POST request, PUT requests and DELETE requests. This was a dope way to dive into some server-side fundamentals.
